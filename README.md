# GameJournalCompanion
Small ongoing project, meant to function as a digital journal for video game players. The initial idea is to allow players to write down side quest stuff, items they found specific vendors selling along with their listed prices, available trades, places left for later exploration when they've leveled up a bit more, etc.
